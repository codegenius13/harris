    </section>

    <section class="information">
        <section class="info">
            <p> I am an African descent, my ethnicity stems from a royal family in a place called the Agbede Kingdom located in within a country now known as Nigeria.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>One of my greatest passion is creating and performing music, in which I do naturally and beautifully well. I was always a 'Music Head' but did not find the talent of creating it until I moved to a new country "in Europe", where I felt oppressed and almost pushed to the brink of violence before the creative part of me fought back and allowed me the opportunity to express myself through art by creating lyrics and melody. And as the lyrics pour down through my hands to the pen and paper, I felt the most healing sensation words can not describe and this brought me back to a positive state of mind and much more.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Share Moments, Share Supplements</h2>
            <p>How I derived the name <strong>‘StoneParaBrahman’</strong>: The name Stone is a translation from one of the 21 names I was given when I born, "Udo" which literally means Stone in Edo language. I chose this name for my musical artistry and stage name because this was the best way or feeling to describe myself. I was a very gentle and peaceful being but tough when trampled on and I also had a strong connection and love to stones and crystals etc
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>My mother always called me ‘The greatest’, she gave me other names like ‘King Solomon the great’ etc. Well there is a saying in Africa that goes:</p>
            <br>
            <div class="info-quote">
                <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
                <h4>Monkey e no fine but im mama like am; Meaning &#8594; He is an ugly monkey but his mother loves him
                </h4>
                <i class="fa fa-quote-right right"></i>
            </div>
            <p>
                So ‘the greatest’ was something that resonated with me later in life and I decided to add a word that I felt had the greatest energy to me ("Para Brahman"is the true self in which Brahman the active part "everything in existence and non existence", consciousness, spirit etc appears from or was born from.
                It is the absolute and only constant true reality, everything else active or non active within it are like illusionary dreams, there is no such thing as an outside of it, it is complete and all inclusive, it is beyond all descriptions and conceptualizations)
            </p>
            <p>I had also worked in various customer service roles and Information Technology/Database roles where I learnt quite a lot about human behavioral patterns and character formations, I had always been enthusiastic and very interested in the evolution of man kind. I always kept an open mind for any type of learning I could get and it did not matter where it came from, I was always keen to seek for more knowledge and understanding. I was the type that would rather learn from other people's experience than to go through a hard knock one myself, this gave me an edge but it is true what they say "Experience is the best teacher" and I too had to go through my own hard knock experiences to know this.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I was the type that would often analyze the expansion of my mind by comparing the way I would handle a situation in the present to how I handled it in the past. I got to a point where I believed I had seen it all or if not then most of it, not knowing that this was only the beginning "I had not seen anything at all". I was to have a re-birth, leading me to the awakening of my true self.
            </p>
            <p>I had a very action packed and interesting life which brought me so many experiences and all the ranges of emotions humanity has to offer, from high excitements all the way down to finally a type of depression that got me analysing again where I was, looking at my ambitions and plans very sadly that they were not anywhere near where I felt they should be at the age I was. At this point the only thing I knew through my belief systems was to pray for a saviour and to apply more force into my ways of achieving my goals, but the more I struck the rock the more tough and difficult it turned out to be.
            </p>
            <h2>Useful Postscript, Important Append</h2>
            <p>It finally happened one day on my way to work when I collapsed and was rushed to the hospital. After a month or two, while doctors were bringing in students to study my physical state and doing all sorts of experiments.
                I got diagnosed with Tuberculosis of the spine and had reached rock bottom 'mentally also', so the only thing I could do was to do 'nothing' and just heal for months. During my recovery the only place I could go now was up, as I was starting afresh. It really brought me to see life in a much more simpler fashion than before, most of my ambitions and plans had faded away and I decided to enjoy and take life a day at a time. I finally got back to work and gradually picked up on some ambitions and plans but this time taking things much more lightly, which allowed me to attract and explore alternative paths that started making more sense to me as I was getting back on my feet. 
            </p>
            <p>I started to realize clues to all the 'questions without answers' who we are, what we came here for, what is the truth and am I on the right track? etc within the believe systems I had while growing up, and started finding outside support to other things I knew inside of me, this brought me out of my shell with more confidence to explore more. From a National Geographic show called 'Ancient Aliens' to the book 'The secret' and the 'Law of attraction', also lead me to a wonderful being called Doctor Wayne Dyer from whom I learnt much, I then moved on to 'Abraham Hicks', 'Bashar' and many other guides, speakers, channelers etc.</p>

            </div>
            <h2>The Only Efforts Should Be For Inner Engineering and Self Realization, Everything Else Follows Suit.</h2>
            <p>It was as if I was in a schooling period where I started researching online etc and one information would lead me to another vital information, mostly specific to whatever I was dealing with or needed at that point in time, always putting me on the next level of elevation towards my own enlightenment.
            </p>
            <p>As I went deeper it all became lighter and easier that before I even opened up my mouth to say I was looking for something, it just showed up at the right time and as I continued the practice it all started making more sense, the right people started showing up at the right moments, everything started becoming more meaningful, right from the simplest things like looking at a butterfly or giving a mere compliment to someone, to the microscopic thoughts and feelings flowing in the mind and heart.</p>
